## Servers in Cloud
servers in the cloud have revolutionzied the IT industry.
> EC2 is a web service from Amazon that provides re-sizable compute services in the cloud.
- Scale capacity up and down based on demands 
- Storage, more money, and computing power can be added as needed
- Obtain servers in minutes 
- No need for onsite hardware or capital expenses

## How are they re-sizable?

they are re-sizable because you can quickly scale up or scale down the
number of server instances you are using if your computing requirements changes.

## What is an instance?
instance is a virtual server for running applications on Amazon's EC2.
It can also understood like a tiny part of a larger computer, which has it's own hard drive, network connection, Os etc

## Difference between a service and an instance 
- EC2 is a service along with other AWS like S3 etc.
- When we use EC2 or any other service, wer use it through an instance eg, t2.micro instance in EC2

## Elastic Cloud Compute (EC2)
Elastic Cloud Compute or EC2 is a foundational piece of AWS cloud computing platform and is a service that provides servers for rent in the cloud.

## Why AWS EC2?
> Why not buy your own stack of servers and work independently? Because, suppose you are a developer, and since you want to work independently you buy some servers, you estimated the correct capacity, and the computing power is enough. Now, you have to look after the updation of security patches every day, you have to troubleshoot any problem which might occur at a back-end level in the servers and so on. These are all extra chores that you will be doing or maybe you will hire someone else to do these things for you.

>But if you buy an EC2 instance, you don’t have to worry about any of these things as it will all be managed by Amazon; you just have to focus on your application. That too, at a fraction of a cost that you were incurring earlier! Isn’t that interesting?


## Pricing Options 
there are serveral pricing options for EC2 
- On Demand -> Pay as you go, no contract 
- Dedicated Hosts -> You have your own dedicated hardware and don't share it with others
- Spot -> You place a bid on an instance price, if there is extra capacity that falls bellow your bid, an EC2 instance is provisioned. If the price goes above your bid while the instance is running, the instance is terminated.
  - Spot instances can save you up to 90% off the no-demand pricing.
- Reserved Instance -> You earn huge discounts if you pay up fornt and sign a 1-3 year contract.

### Types of EC2 Computing instances:
1. General Instances
   - For applications that require a balance of performance and cost.
   - E.g email responding systems, where you need a prompt response as well as it should be cost-effective since it doesn’t require much processing.
2. Compute Instances
   - For applications that require a lot of processing from the CPU.
   - E.g analysis of data from a stream of data, like a Twitter stream.
3. Memory Instances
   - For applications that are heavy in nature, therefore, require a lot of RAM.
   - E.g when your system needs a lot of applications running in the background i.e multitasking.
4. Storage Instances
   - For applications that are huge in size or have a data set that occupies a lot of space.
   - E.g When your application is of huge size.

5. GPU Instances
   - For applications that require some heavy graphics rendering.
   - E.g 3D modeling etc.

#### Every instance type has a set of instances which are optimized for different workloads:
1. General Instances **( t2 - m4 - m3 )**
2. Compute Instances **( c4 - c3 )**
3. Memort Instances **( r3 - x1)**
4. Storage Instances **( i2 - d2)**
5. Gpu Instances **(g2)**

## Uderstanding each instance
### Burstable Performance Instances
T2 instances are burstable instances, meaning the CPU performs at a baseline, say 20% of its capability. When your application needs more than 20% of the performance of the CPU, the CPU enters into a burst mode giving the higher performance for a limited amount of time, therefore work happens faster.

- You get these credits when your CPU is idle.
- Each CPU credit gives a burst of 1 minute to the CPU.
- If your CPU credits are not used they are credited to your account and they stay there for 24 hours.
- Based on your credit balance, you can decide whether the t2 instance, should be scaled up or down.
- These bursts happen at a cost, every time a burst happens in a CPU, CPU credits are used.


### EBS-Optimized Instances
C4, M4, and D2 instances are EBS optimized by default, EBS means Elastic Block Storage, which is a storage option provided by AWS in which the IOPS* rate is quite high. Therefore, when an EBS volume is attached to an optimized instance, single-digit millisecond latencies can be achieved.

>*IOPS (Input/Output Operations Per Second, pronounced eye-ops) is a performance measurement used to characterize computer storage devices.

### Cluster Networking Instances
X1, M4, C4, C3, I2, G2 and D2 instances support cluster networking. Instances launched into a common placement group are put in a logical group that provides high-bandwidth, low latency between all the instances in the group.
- A placement group is basically a logical cluster where some select EC2 instances which are a part of that group can utilize up to 10Gbps for single flow and 20Gbps for multi-flow traffic in each direction.
- Instances which are not a part of that group are limited to 5 Gbps speed in multi-flow traffic. Cluster Networking is ideal for high-performance analytics system

### Dedicated Instances
- They are the instances that run on single-tenant hardware dedicated to a single customer.
- They are perfect for workloads where a corporate policy or industry regulation requires that your instance should be isolated from any other customer’s instance, therefore they go for their own separate machines, and their instances are isolated at the hardware level.

# Elastic Block Store
Elastic Block Store (EBS) is a storage solution for EC2 instances and is a physical hard drive that is attached to the EC2 instance to increase storage.

### Volume Types
AWS allows the following types of volumes to be created. Each type of volume has its service capacity. Choose a type based on the underlying application.

According to AWS:
- General Purpose SSD volumes can serve at a rate of [100-3000] IOPS with a consistent baseline of 3 IOPS/GB.

- Provisioned IOPS SSD volumes can deliver up to 64000 IOPS, and are best for EBS-optimized instances.

- Cold HDD and Throughput Optimized HDD types of volume have their predefined throughput (MB/s) with a standard baseline.

- Magnetic volumes, previously called standard volumes, deliver 100 IOPS on average.

## Security
security in the cloud allows you to have complete control over you virtual networking environment 

- Configure your virtual netowk with public or private facing subnets
- Launch your servers in the selected network to secure access.

## Virtual private cloud (VPC)
virtual private cloud or VPC allows you to create your own private network in the cloud, You can lanunch services like EC2, inside of that private network, A VPC spans all the Availability zones in the region.

Vpc allows you to control your virtual networking environment, which includes:
- IP address ranges
- Subnets
- Route tables
- Network gateways

#### Tips 
- VPC is found under Networking & Content Delivery section of the AWS Management Console.
- The default time is 5 VPCs per REgion, You can request an increase of thses limits.
- Your AWS resouces are automatically provisioned in a default VPC.
- There are no additional charges for creating and using the VPC.
- You can store data in Amazon S3 and restrict access so that it's only accessible from instances in your VPC.


### Compute power in the cloud 
compute power in the cloud is a faster way to build applications, providing 
- no servers to manage (i.e serverless)
- ability to continuously scale
- ability to run code on demand in response to events 
- pay only when your code runs


## Lambda 
Aws lambda provides you with computing power in the cloud by allowing you to execute code without standing up or managing servers

#### Tips
- lambda is found under the compute section on the AWS Management Console.
- Lambdas have a time limit of 15 minutes.
- The code you run on AWS Lambda is called a "Lambda function"
- Lambda code can be tiggered by other AWS services 
- AWS Lambda supports java, Go, PowerShell , Node.js, C#/.Net , python and Ruby. there's a runtime API that allows you to use other programming languages to author your function. 
- Lamda code can be authored via the console.


### Elastic BeanStalk
Elastic BeanStalks is an orchestration service that allows you to deploy a wen application at the touch of a button by spinning up (or provisioning) all of the services that you need to run your application.

#### tips 
- Elastic BeanStalk is found under the compute section of the AWS Management Console.
- Elastic BeanStalk can be used to deploy web applications developed with java, .net, Node.Js .... 
- You can run your applications in VPC.
