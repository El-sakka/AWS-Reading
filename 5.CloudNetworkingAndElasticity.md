# Networking
Networks reliably carry loads of data around the globe allowing for the delivery of content and applications with high availability. The network is the foundation of your infrastructure.

Cloud networking includes:
- network architecture 
- network connectivity 
- application delivery 
- global performance 
- delivery 


## Route 53
Route 53 is a cloud domain system (DNS) service that has servers distributed. around the globe used to translates human-readable names like www.google.com into the numeric IP addresses like 74.125.21.147.

### Features
- scales automatically to manage spikes in DNS queries
- allows you to register a domain name (or manage an existing)
- routes internet traffic to the resources for your domain
- checks the health of your resources

#### Tips
- Route 53 allows you to route users based on the user's geographic location



## Elasticity in the Cloud
one of the main benefits of the cloud is that it allows you to stop guessing about capacity when you need to run your applications. sometimes you buy too much or you don't buy enough to support the running of your applications.

with elasticity, your servers, databases, and application resouces can automatically scale up or scale down based on load.

- Scale up : vertical scaling by resizing an instance to add more capacity
- Scale out: horizontal scaling by increasing the number of servers in the farm.

## EC2 Auto Scaling 
EC2 Auto Scaling is a service that monitors your EC2 instances and automatically adjusts by adding or removing EC2 instances based on conditions you define in order to maintain application availability and provide peak performance to your users.

### Features 
- Automatically scale in and out based on needs 
- Included automatically with Amazon EC2
- Automate how you Amazon EC2 instances are managed

#### Tips

- EC2 Auto Scaling is found on the EC2 Dashboard
- EC2 Auto Scaling adds instances onlyu when needed, optimizing cost savings.
- EC2 predictive scaling removes the need for manaul adjustment of auto scaling parameters over time.


EC2 Auto Scaling is a service that ensures you have the desired number of EC2 instances always up and running to handle the expected load for your application. To set-up an Auto Scaling group, you require the following basic details:

1. Count of instances - The desired count of the EC2 instances you want to have available. If any instance goes down/fails, a new instance automatically spins up.
2. Launch template - The auto scaling group contains a collection of EC2 instances that are treated as a logical group. All EC2 instances within a group share the same configuration. Therefore, You need to specify the configuration details, such as, the ID of the Amazon Machine Image (AMI), the instance type, a key pair, security groups, and the other parameters that you use to launch EC2 instances. You specify the configuration details in a Launch template.
3. Scaling policy - The auto scaling policy that defines how to scale your EC2 instances automatically, based on demand



## Elastic Load Balancing
Elastic Load Balancing automatically distibutes incoming application traffic across multiple servers.

Elastic Load Balancer is a service that:
- Balances load between two or more servers
- stands in front of a web server 
- provides redundancy and performance 

#### Tips 
- Elastic Load Balancing works with EC2 instances, containers, IP addresses , and Lambda functions 
- you can configure Amazon EC2 instances to only accept traffic from a load balancer

> Redundancy : if you lose a server, the load balancer will send requests to other working servers. this feature maintain continuous opertations in an emergency 

> Performance : if a server starts having issues or bottlenecks, the load balancer will add more servers to the pool of available servers. Auto Scaling automatically adjusts capacity to maintain a steady state
