# AWS Management
## Logging in the cloud 
Logging provides visiblity into your cloud resources and applications. for applications that run in the cloud, you will need access to logging and auditing services to help you proactively monitor your resources and applications.

Logging allows you to answer important questions like:
- How is this server performing?
- what is the current load on the server ?
- what is the root cause of an application error that a user is seeing?
- what is the path that leads to this error?


## CloudTrail 
CloudTrail allows you to audit (or review) everything that occurs in your aws account. Cloud trail does this by recording all the AWS API Calls occurring in your account and delivering a log file to you.

### Features
Cloud Trail provides event history of your AWS account activity, including:
- Who has logged in.
- services that were accessed.
- actions performed.
- parameters for the actions.
- responses returned.

this includes actions taken through the AWS Management Console, AWS SDks, command line tools and other AWS services.
