# Storage in the cloud
storage and database services in the cloud provide a place for companies to collect, store and analyze the data they've collected over the years at a massive scale.

- Storage services in the cloud provide a place for companies to store data providing serveral benifits like:
  - Durability
    - Durablitiy guranatees that you will not lose the data that you upload to the cloud.
    - High durability gives you the peace of mind that your data will be there in the future.
  - Availablity 
    - Availablity addresses how quickly you can access your data.
    - High Availablity provides fast and reliable access to the data you stored in the cloud.
  - Scalability
    - Scalability allows applications running in your environment to always meet demand seamlessly.
    - Automatically Adding and removing resources, necessary to maintain steady-state and fast response times.
    - There're 3 types of Scaling
      1. Vertical scaling
      2. Horizontal Scaling
      3. diagonal Scaling

### Storage & Database Services
- Amazon simple storage service (Amazon S3)
- Amazon Simple storage service (Amazon S3) Glacier
- DynamoDB
- Relational Database service (RDS)
- Redshift
- ElastiCache
- Neptune
- Amazon DocumentDB

## S3 & S3 Glacier
Amazon Simple Storage Service (or S3) is an object storage system in the cloud.

### Use cases
- static websites
- Content devlivery 
- Backup and recovery 
- Archiving and big data 
- Application data 

### Storage classes 
S3 offers serval strogae classes , which are different data access levels for your data at certain price points.
- S3 Standard
- S3 Glacier
- S3 Glacier Deep Archive
- S3 Intelligent-Tiering
- S3 Standard Infrequent Access
- S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access

#### Tips
- S3 is found under the storage section on the AWS management console. 
- A single object can be up to 5 terabytes in size 
- you can enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) Delete on S3 bucket to prevent accidental deletions
- S3 Acceleration can be used to enable fast, easy and secure transfers of files over long distances between your data source and your s3 bucket.


## DynamoDB
DynamoDB is a NoSQL document database service that is fully managed. Unlike traditional databases, NoSQL databases, are schema-less. Schema-less simply means that the database doesn't contain a fixed (or rigid) data structure.


#### Tips
- DynamoDB is found under the Database section on the AWS Management Console.
- DynamoDB can handle more than 10 trillion requests per day.
- DynamoDB is serverless as there are no servers to provision, patch, or manage.
- DynamoDB supports key-value and document data models.
- DynamoDB synchronously replicates data across three AZs in an AWS Region.
- DynamoDB supports GET/PUT operations using a primary key.

## Relational Database Service (RDS)
RDS (or Relational Database service) is a service that aids in the administration and management of database. RDS assists with database administrative tasks that include upgrades, patching, installs, backups, monitoring, performance checks, security,etc.

## Database Engine support 
- Oracle 
- PostgreSQL
- MySql
- MariaDB
- Sql server 
## Features
- failover
- backups
- restore
- encryption 
- security 
- monitoring
- data replication 
- scalability 


## RedShift
Redshift is a cloud data warehoursing service to help companies manage big data. Redshift allows to run fast queries against your data using SQL,ETL,and BI tools. Redshift stores data in column format to aid in fast querying.

#### Tips
- Redshit delivers great perfomance by using machine learning.
- Redshit spectrum is a feature that enables you to run queries against data in Amazon S3.
- Redshift encrypts and keeps your data secure in transit add at rest.
- Redshift clusters can be isolated using Amazon Virtual private cloud(VPC).


## content Delivery in the Cloud
A content delivery network (or CDN) speeds up delivery of your static and dynamic web content by caching content in an Edge location close to your user base.

#### Benefits 
- low latency 
- decreased server load
- better user experience


## CloudFront
cloudFront is used as a global content devlivey network (CDN). CloudFront sppeds up the delivery of your content through Amazon's worldwide network of mini-data centers called Edge Locations.

CloudFonts works with other AWS service, as shown below, as an origin source for your application.
- Amazon S3
- Elastic Load Balancing
- Amazon EC2
- lambda@Edge
- AWS Shielf

#### Tips 
- Amazon continously adds new Edge Locations
- CloudFront ensures that end-user requests are served from the closest edge location.
- CloudFront works with non-AWS origin sources.
- You can use GeoIP blocking to serve content (or not serve content) to specific countries.
- Cache control headers determine how frequently CloudFront needs to check the origin for an updated version of your file.
- The maximum size of a single file that can be delivered through Amazon CloudFront is 20 GB.
